## What I Do

I'm a builder at heart who loves working with technology that makes a difference. My obsession with automation and building led me to Site Reliability Engineering, focussing on deployment automation, and bridging the gap between development and operations.

## Tech Stack

```python
def my_skills():
    return {
        "languages": ["Python", "Bash"],
        "infrastructure": ["Terraform", "Docker", "Kubernetes", "Linux", "GCP"],
        "specialties": ["SRE", "Cloud", "Automation", "Infrastructure Engineering"],
        "passion": ["Building reliable systems", "Continuous learning"]
    }
```

## What Drives Me

- **Building**: Passionate about building technology that solves real problems and ships value to people
- **Automate Everything**: I'm all-in on freeing up time for solving more interesting problems
- **Continuous Improvement**: Always looking for ways to build better systems and processes
- **Curiosity & Learning**: I'm naturally curious and believe in constantly re-educating myself

## Beyond Code

- ✈️ **Traveling** - Exploring new places and cultures
- 🛠️ **Building Side Projects** - Experimenting with new technologies
